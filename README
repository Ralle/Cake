Cake - Publishing changed files over SSH/FTP

How to use:

Creates a cake-repository in the current folder. Do this in the root folder of a project.
cake init

Set up the repository. thePath is the relative path to the home folder of the user account on the remote server.
The following protocols are supported: ftp/scp/local. The remote path of local has to be non-relative.
cake config host ftp.google.com
cake config user theUser
cake config pass thePass
cake config path thePath
cake config protocol theProtocol

Now you can sync:
cake

If you want to see what will be transferred do this:
cake n
This is a dry run, like with rsync.

The following command looks through all files and cleans up states for files that are missing:
cake cleanup

Print the repository data:
cake debug

Mark every file as not changed.
cake done

Mark every file as changed.
cake reset

Ignore a given path.
